        <h2>📜 <u>The History of Java </u>:</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 22px; margin-left:25px;">It is the largest installed base among various mobile platforms across the globe. Hundreds of millions of mobile devices are powered by Android in more than 190 countries of the world. It conquered around 71% of the global market share by the end of 2021, and this trend is growing bigger every other day.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 22px; margin-left:25px;">Java was developed in 1991 by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems. It was initially called Oak, inspired by an oak tree outside Gosling’s office. Later, it was renamed Java (inspired by coffee ☕) before its official release in 1995.</p>
